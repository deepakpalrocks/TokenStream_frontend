# Background Image Setup

Please place your background image file in this `public` folder and name it `background-image.png`.

The image should be the futuristic graphic showing the cylindrical structure with flowing coins, as shown in the landing page design.

Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP

If you use a different filename or format, update the path in `src/LandingPage.jsx`:
```jsx
<img src="/your-image-name.png" alt="TokenStream Platform" className="background-image" />
```
